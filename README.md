# GemCAD File Reader
A simple cross-platform .NET library for reading Gemcad .ASC and .GEM files into polygon arrays, ready to render.

TestViewer is provided as a way to use this library to load a GEM or ASC file and render the resulting geometry. It is an ASP.NET Core 6 project. It was created using Rider, but Visual Studio should work just fine to modify it.

GemCad ASC file support was originally based on code in the following repository: https://github.com/sftdevstar/GemCad-Viewer
